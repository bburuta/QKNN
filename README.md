This implementation condiders a dataset of numbers 0-8 in binary form and classify it into even or odd.
the results are not stable as the vector dimension of data point is 3 and the number of points are 6 (too low!!)

  
  reqirement = {

        'qiskit-terra': '0.16.1', 
        'qiskit-aer': '0.7.1', 
        'qiskit-ignis': '0.5.1', 
        'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.11.1',
